<h1>Personal Information </h1>
<img src="me.jpg" style="width: 350px;">
<p>Hello, my name is Tingyu Gong, you can call my English name, Aaron. I am from a country with 5,000 years of historical civilization - China. As everyone knows, some foreign friends may think that China's current bridge technology, high-speed rail roads, Internet 5G and other technologies are ahead of the world, but I am more willing to introduce you to China's moral culture. As early as more than 2,000 years ago, Confucianism in the pre-Qin period of China paid great attention to moral cultivation. Later, after the inheritance and continuous improvement of the philosophers of the past generations, the theory of moral cultivation with long-standing, rich content, self-contained system and unique characteristics was formed. And my hometown is an ancient city of historical civilization, Hefei. Before I came to Australia to study, I completead my high school education and completed the foundation course at RMIT. My native language is Mandarin and the second language is English. I think after many years, I will be proficient in more "language", such as: C++, Java, etc. (hahahaha).

 <p>I have a Teddy dog, her Chinese name is Fazai, and the homonym means to make a fortune. When I go home from school, my first thing is to take her for a walk. In my spare time of learning, I like hip-hop music, and I like to read classical literary classics. When I first get helpless, they can bring me strength.

<h1>Interest to IT</h1>
<h3>My fate with IT</h3>
<p>Before I learned IT in my system, the IT I knew was the easy-to-understand information technology. Through some technology, information is transmitted to all places where the Internet is located, and exchanges are shared. What I am really interested in is the knowledge lecture that happened in my junior high school. The teacher vividly explained the operation of the Internet and the meaning of IT. As the age grows, it is full of inner depth for IT.

When I chose to study abroad, I consulted many teachers and elders. Some teachers suggested that I could choose to study in Australia and explained the differences and advantages of different countries. Coincidentally, my aunt came to Melbourne many years ago through immigration. She helped me analyze the characteristics of different majors in different universities in Melbourne, the future employment trends and many other reasons. In combination with my own conditions, I chose RMIT.

Now that I have started my college career and are in the basics of the freshman year, I hope that in the three years of undergraduate study, I can master a series of programming languages including C++, Java, etc., and can be more thorough. Going to see IT itself. When I choose the professional scope in the later stage of study, I prefer to choose data analysis and artificial intelligence, because I think that in the future development of information technology, these two have always occupied a great advantage.
</p>



<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

<p>My own major is information technology. In my future university study planning, I will focus on artificial intelligence, learn and understand the basic components of artificial intelligence and the current series of technical problems. After I completed my undergraduate study, I became an AI engineer when I was ideal. In my opinion, AI technology is the mainstream of the future world. People will no longer need to do heavy physical work, all work and production, etc., only need to be handed over to the staff, and people's work is to enjoy life and enjoy. The beauty brought by technology, the robot that manages these jobs. At the moment, I am not sure whether I will stay overseas or return to my home country, China. If you choose to live overseas, I hope to have the opportunity to apply for Google's work on artificial intelligence. In this field, Google is undoubtedly the world leader. In addition, as an Internet technology company, Google's internal resources and learning environment can help me a lot, so that I can constantly improve my skills. If you return to China, China's Tencent, NetEase, Alibaba and other companies also have inferior results in the Internet field. Compared with some small-scale companies, the experimental facilities of these companies, the cultural concepts of enterprises, etc., will be more attractive to me.

I am still in the first year of college, and the knowledge I have learned can't cope with my ideal work, and I have already felt the pressure of the difficulty of the course. The programming languages that will be used in the future, such as C++, Java, etc., are still in the introductory stage. Therefore, I can't be limited to classroom learning. In my spare time, I also need to take a certain amount of time to continuously improve my ability. I plan to be proficient in these skills for three years, and I will choose to pursue a master's degree if necessary.

<h1>Profile</h1>
<h3>Sub Section</h3>
<p>I have completed the Myers Briggs test, although in my opinion, some of the ideas listed in the test results do correspond to my own situation, but some of the analysis I think is not consistent with the facts. For example: the results of the analysis tell I said that my view of things is more stubborn, but the fact is that I am a very good person. For some current affairs news, friends, family schools and so on, a series of people and things, my views and attitudes are constantly changing. Of course, the test concluded that I am a careful person. Because of this, I will carefully observe my life and constantly strengthen my understanding of others, and my attitude towards things is constantly updated. The test results report also details that I am a stubborn and insensitive person. I personally think this is a conflict. On most occasions, I will stick to my own point of view and make reasonable arguments with others. Based on the proof to show me, I will also accept the final conclusion, which in turn explains that I am a stubborn and sensitive person. In this regard, I have some doubts about the accuracy of the test.

As far as the results of the test are concerned, in the future teamwork, whether it is the learning phase or the work phase, I am more willing to pay for the team. I am recognized about this. I think that I am a bit like a workaholic. I am willing to work to achieve self-worth. But one thing I need to elaborate is that compared to teamwork, I personally prefer to work independently. Of course, in the team, when encountering problems, everyone can come up with solutions, but in my opinion, each has its own advantages.

When I need to work as a team member, I don't pay special attention to this test result. I think that for me, many of the conclusions it gives are not consistent with my actual situation. This does not mean that I will I completely turn a blind eye to this. Only on this basis, there are more physical contacts with all members, and then make the final decision.

<h1>Product ideas</h1>
<h3>Human body chip&Smaet bracelet</h3>
<p>Regarding my ideal product concept, my idea is whether there can be something like a small chip implanted in the human body, or by wearing a way to connect people's thinking with the network.  By then, people will no longer need a series of electronic products such as mobile phones, computers, and televisions in their daily lives, and they only need to use these functions through their own brains.  I know that although this idea has been proposed by many people, it is still a technology I want to implement.
</p>
<p>I have this idea that happened in junior high school, and the process is actually quite funny.  At that time, because the test scores were excellent, I was admitted to a good high school in the local area, and my parents rewarded me with a mobile phone.  That is the first time in my life that I have my own mobile phone. The Internet addiction is so big that when I was living in high school, I was thinking about playing mobile phones all the time. The performance dropped very badly. I often browse social media all night, with friends.  Communicate through WeChat... As the phone continues to affect my daily life, the family has to confiscate it.  In the absence of a mobile phone, I can say that it is like a year, so that afterwards, I can connect to the Internet, watch videos, and communicate with others with my brain.
</p>
<p>There are currently seven billion people in the world. Although there are poor people in every country and region who cannot use these electronic devices, for most people, everyone has a mobile phone, possibly with headphones.  For other devices such as computers, resource consumption is huge.  If you just have a small chip and implant it into your body, you can discard other electronic devices.  Or wearing a smart bracelet, you can present information through holographic impression technology, how cool it will be.  Of course, in my opinion, the latter will be more likely to be developed.  At that time, the paper currency will also slowly withdraw from the market. When people consume, they only need the brain connection program to directly confirm the payment, and they can directly deduct from the online bank.  If you are using a wearable device, you only need to scan to complete the payment.  When people want to browse social media, TV dramas, movies and other information, the chip will directly send information to the brain, and even within a few seconds, all the information can be known to achieve an efficient state, and the wearable device will be able to holographic projection.  Browse the information and manipulate it with a virtual touch.
</p>
<p>For the service function and object of the product, I think there is no age limit. At least in the future, I think there is a technical solution to it, including one of my ideas: implanting a chip in the body.  If the two ideas make me only choose one, I think wearing the device will be a better choice.  On the one hand, as far as the current development is concerned, it is difficult for people to accept the inoculation of smart chips into the body through surgery or in some form; on the other hand, there are still a series of safety hazards in implanting the chips into the body.  And wear the device, you only need to wear it to complete, smaller size, more functions...
</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of implementing these two technologies is compatibility. By then, there will be no diversified operating systems such as iOS and Android in the world, and there will be a unified way to use all software.  Second, a very important point: security.  Whether it is planting chips or wearing equipment, whether it is harm to human health or data protection, it is a prerequisite for this project.  Regarding skills, I think developers must be an emotional person. I don't want this project to feel no humanization during use.  In writing, I am currently learning Java, and I learned C++ at the RMIT foundation.  In comparison, I think Java will be more suitable for developing this project.
</p>
<p>If these two projects can be realized in the future, it will inevitably become a breakthrough in the century.  But along with various conveniences, energy savings, and efficiency of doing things, there are also many shortcomings, some of which can be said to be fatal.  If the human body can grow chips, they can do all the work through the brain. Students don't need to go to class. They only need the brain to connect to the Internet to download a series of knowledge points. Most adults no longer need to go to work, all documents.  Both can be edited in the brain and uploaded and shared in real time.  People will become lazy and have no entrepreneurial spirit.  When the technology is highly completed, people will even lose their language functions and expressions, whether they are face-to-face or far apart, they can use this chip to connect to the Internet and tell others what they want to express, which will be very scary. If people just use the wearable device to use all the electronic devices around us today (I personally think it can be realized in the near future), this device must contain a lot of important personal information, once lost, or some  A kind of virus invasion, large-scale personal data information is stolen, or exposed in the Internet era, the losses faced are huge for individuals, families, enterprises, countries, and even the world.  Therefore, I believe that with the continuous development and improvement of science and technology, technology has entered our lives and brought us great convenience.  But at the same time, we also need to be prepared for the challenges that will come.

<h1>Personal Information </h1>
<img src="me.jpg" style="width: 350px;">
<p>Hello, my name is Tingyu Gong, you can call my English name, Aaron. I am from a country with 5,000 years of historical civilization - China. As everyone knows, some foreign friends may think that China's current bridge technology, high-speed rail roads, Internet 5G and other technologies are ahead of the world, but I am more willing to introduce you to China's moral culture. As early as more than 2,000 years ago, Confucianism in the pre-Qin period of China paid great attention to moral cultivation. Later, after the inheritance and continuous improvement of the philosophers of the past generations, the theory of moral cultivation with long-standing, rich content, self-contained system and unique characteristics was formed. And my hometown is an ancient city of historical civilization, Hefei. Before I came to Australia to study, I completead my high school education and completed the foundation course at RMIT. My native language is Mandarin and the second language is English. I think after many years, I will be proficient in more "language", such as: C++, Java, etc. (hahahaha). I have a Teddy dog, her Chinese name is Fazai, and the homonym means to make a fortune. When I go home from school, my first thing is to take her for a walk. In my spare time of learning, I like hip-hop music, and I like to read classical literary classics. When I first get helpless, they can bring me strength.

<h1>Interest to IT</h1>
<h3>My fate with IT</h3>
<p>Before I learned IT in my system, the IT I knew was the easy-to-understand information technology. Through some technology, information is transmitted to all places where the Internet is located, and exchanges are shared. What I am really interested in is the knowledge lecture that happened in my junior high school. The teacher vividly explained the operation of the Internet and the meaning of IT. As the age grows, it is full of inner depth for IT.

When I chose to study abroad, I consulted many teachers and elders. Some teachers suggested that I could choose to study in Australia and explained the differences and advantages of different countries. Coincidentally, my aunt came to Melbourne many years ago through immigration. She helped me analyze the characteristics of different majors in different universities in Melbourne, the future employment trends and many other reasons. In combination with my own conditions, I chose RMIT.

Now that I have started my college career and are in the basics of the freshman year, I hope that in the three years of undergraduate study, I can master a series of programming languages including C++, Java, etc., and can be more thorough. Going to see IT itself. When I choose the professional scope in the later stage of study, I prefer to choose data analysis and artificial intelligence, because I think that in the future development of information technology, these two have always occupied a great advantage.

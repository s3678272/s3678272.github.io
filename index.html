 Hello, my name is Tingyu Gong, you can call my English name, Aaron. I am from a country with 5,000 years of historical civilization - China. As everyone knows, some foreign friends may think that China's current bridge technology, high-speed rail roads, Internet 5G and other technologies are ahead of the world, but I am more willing to introduce you to China's moral culture. As early as more than 2,000 years ago, Confucianism in the pre-Qin period of China paid great attention to moral cultivation. Later, after the inheritance and continuous improvement of the philosophers of the past generations, the theory of moral cultivation with long-standing, rich content, self-contained system and unique characteristics was formed. And my hometown is an ancient city of historical civilization, Hefei. Before I came to Australia to study, I completead my high school education and completed the foundation course at RMIT. My native language is Mandarin and the second language is English. I think after many years, I will be proficient in more "language", such as: C++, Java, etc. (hahahaha). I have a Teddy dog, her Chinese name is Fazai, and the homonym means to make a fortune. When I go home from school, my first thing is to take her for a walk. In my spare time of learning, I like hip-hop music, and I like to read classical literary classics. When I first get helpless, they can bring me strength.
